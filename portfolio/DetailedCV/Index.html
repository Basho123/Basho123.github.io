          <br />
          <p>
            As a most recent highlight and cross-related web/game development
            task, i was the <b>Lead Developer</b> for a
            <b>game purely coded in Vue 3 and CSS</b> by using
            <b>Javascript</b> and <b>Typescript</b>, and some <b>SCSS</b> and
            <b>Tailwind</b> incorporated in <b>Vuetify</b>, that was used as a
            corporate training game for A1 Telekom, accessible in all branches
            throughout Europe, which won a reward for
            <b>Project of the year 2024</b> in Austria in the category
            <b>Internal Communications</b>, (posted on my linkedin profile
            <a
              href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7299708225451388928/"

              >here</a
            >)
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Now, from the beginning. As game developer i had the opportunity to
            learn the basics of programming in <b>p5.js</b> javascript game
            development engine that is more like a learning engine, where i
            created my first game, which i simply called
            <a href="https://www.ambroz.mk/portfolio/Tanks/Index.html">Tanks</a
            >, which gave me a lot of insight into how game development works,
            how to create a game loop, how to handle user input and how basic
            programming concepts apply in game development. The game is only
            playable on PC with numpad controls keyboard.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Shortly after, immeresed myself in my first working experience at
            X3M Labs - 4F Studios as game developer with
            <b>Phaser.js 2 and 3</b>, where i developed multiple games, from
            simple 2D platformers to more complex games requiring
            <b>WEBGL</b> and using <b>GLSL shaders</b>, particle systems and
            other advanced techniques for improving visual experience, and
            creating isometric tile system. During this time i have brushed on
            on some <b>Adobe Photoshop skills</b>, which helped me create some
            of the game assets, and also learned how to use <b>Spine</b> and
            <b>Creature</b> for creating animations for the games, albeit not
            extensively, but enough to create some basic animations for ideas i
            had so to be passed on to the artists to create more polished
            animations.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Few years later, i came across <b>Three.js</b>, which i first
            utilized for 3D website development, creating interactive and unique
            3D experience where the website itself can be explored at
            <b>First Person View</b> and has a minigame to perform some songs of
            the band similar to Guitar Hero (found under "perform" tab), thus
            combining game development into web development. The website is on
            this <a href="https://www.ambroz.mk/">link</a>. During this time i
            also had the freedom to explore <b>WEBGL2</b> and
            <b>WEBGPU</b> capabilities, by which grasping the fundamentals of 3D
            graphics programming, and how to use shaders to create more complex
            visual effects, such as Unreal Bloom, and how to use the GPU for
            rendering 3D objects in a more efficient way, thus utilizing the
            full potential of the browser and the GPU. While building the
            website i have experimented with lots of fragment and vertex
            shaders. Although in the website source code the in built three.js
            predefined shaders are used, i have created my own custom fragment
            shaders earlier when trying to implement more efficient blur under
            WEBGL1. While exploring the needs and ideas for the website, i have
            also learned basic navigation in <b>Blender 4</b>, and how to export
            3D models in glTF/glb format and doing some simple polygon
            optimizations.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            During my time as game developer i have also come to known and
            acquainted various texture and 3D formats that are used in game
            development, that can be as well used in web development for
            optimizing resources, such as compressed textures, and 3D models,
            such as <b>glTF/glb</b> and <b>draco</b> compression, texture
            compression like <b>BASIS</b> which are used to optimize the loading
            times of the game assets and be optimized for broader range of
            devices, thus improving the overall performance of the game or
            website. While having the experience as a sound engineer, i also
            have a professional knowledge of using professional DAW software
            <b>Cubase</b> by which i can edit and design sound effects for the
            game or website i need, as well as knowing the best way to compress
            audio files for the web, such as using <b>ogg</b> and
            <b>mp3</b> formats, and how to use them in the games and websites,
            so that they can be played on all browsers and devices, as well as
            video formats and codecs.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            By the time i finished the
            <a href="https://www.ambroz.mk/">ambroz</a> website, i have written
            lot of <b>recursive converters</b> to make the conversions of
            various file formats, either
            <b>image, video, texture, audio converters,</b> which i am also
            happy to use and share them in any professional projects, so that
            the conversion and development is simplified and automated for
            faster development and converted to the best possible format
            realtime, with that enabling the website or the game to be built
            with ease at any notice.

          <h2 class="rightSideHeadlines">As a front-end developer</h2>
          <hr />
          <br />
          <p>
            As a most recent highlight for frontend development, A project i
            work on as a sole frontend developer (95% of the codebase) was
            awarded for
            <b
              >Project with most impact to the sales employees of A1 Telekom in
              Croatia</b
            >, but due to the closed nature of that web-application and NDA,
            there is limited public amount of data which can be disclosed
            regarding this achievment.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Now, from the beginning. As a frontend developer i first came into
            contact while attending an academy for full stack web development
            where i have learned the basics of web development, how to create
            responsive websites, how to use <b>CSS</b> for styling and layout,
            and how to use <b>JavaScript</b> for adding interactivity to the
            websites. I have also learned how to use <b>Git</b> for version
            control and how to use <b>npm</b> for managing dependencies during
            the course of the academy. During the time i made lots of personal
            projects and was carefully exploring the programming world. Then
            half way while attending the academy, i was hired as a game
            developer which helped me immerse into the profession of developer,
            but my styding for frontend and backend development didnt came to a
            hold, but rather continued more vigorously, knowing i am backed up
            by already having a development job and ensuring my path as a future
            developer that can easily shift between technologies.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            After finishing the academy, I was offered a job at the academy as
            an
            <b>assistant lecturer</b>, where I helped students with their
            projects, explained core frontend concepts, and assisted in
            organizing workshops. This experience strengthened my communication
            skills and deepened my understanding of frontend and backend
            technologies, as I was often required to break down complex topics
            into simple, understandable terms for students. One year after
            serving as an assistant lecturer,
            <b>I advanced to the role of lecturer</b> myself, taking on full
            responsibility for teaching courses, preparing materials, and
            mentoring students through their learning journey. While lecturing,
            I also had the opportunity to communicate with other lecturers that
            were themselves working on various technologies and projects, which
            allowed me to update my knowledge and skills.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Then after a few years of working as a game developer, i was
            approached by a company to work as a <b>frontend web developer</b>,
            where i am currently able to apply my knowledge of frontend and
            backend, but later on that. During this time in Leanworx, i have
            worked on various projects, from simple web applications or
            solutions, to more <b>complex SaaS</b> (Software as a Service)
            applications, which are web-based software solutions delivered over
            the internet and typically accessed via a browser without the need
            for local installation. During this time i am working on a SaaS app,
            i am having the opportunity to be in direct link and ability to
            directly communicate the end users, which i have the freedom to
            contact directly in Microsoft Teams if they report some difficulty,
            which i find pleasing since i hate hiding behind corporate walls and
            prefer to be in direct contact with the end users, so that i can
            understand their needs and requirements better, and thus improve the
            overall user experience of the application.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            One of the technologies i am most involved at the time are
            <b>Vue 3</b> with incorporating add-ons like <b>Vuetify</b>,<b
              >Vite</b
            >
            and <b>Pinia</b>, which i have learned to use extensively, and also
            <b>Typescript</b> for better type safety and code maintainability. I
            have also worked with <b>Angular</b> and <b>React</b> before,
            altough not extensively, but enough to understand the core concepts
            of these frameworks and how they can be used to create modern web
            applications. I believe by knowing the core concept of either one of
            the three big frontend frameworks, one can easily adapt to the other
            two, or their derivatives like <b>Next.js</b> or <b>Nuxt.js</b>,
            since they are all based on the same principles of component-based
            architecture, state management, and reactive programming. Also by
            having the access of AI powered tools like <b>Copilot</b> and
            <b>ChatGPT</b>, i am able to quickly adapt to new technologies and
            frameworks, as they can provide me with instant feedback and
            suggestions on how to implement certain features or solve problems,
            thus speeding up the development process and improving the overall
            quality and delivery of the code.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            One little extra, by being a musician and immersing myself in the
            world of photography, i have developed a keen eye for detail and
            artistic aesthetics, which i believe is crutucial for any frontend
            developer. I have learned how to create visually appealing and
            user-friendly interfaces, and how to use design principles to create
            a cohesive and consistent user experience. I have also learned how
            to use various design tools, such as <b>Adobe Photoshop</b> and
            <b>Figma</b>, to create mockups and prototypes for web applications,
            which helps in visualizing the final product before starting the
            development process. This artistic sense and attention to detail has
            helped me in creating and developing UI/UX designs that are not only
            functional but also visually appealing and engaging for the end
            users.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I should also mention that all the skills and knowledge i have
            acquired during my time as a game developer, i have applied them in
            my work as a frontend developer, such as <b>problem solving</b>,
            <b>teamwork</b>, <b>strategic thinking</b>,
            <b>critical thinking</b>, <b>artistic sense</b>,
            <b>OOP principles</b>, <b>analytical skills</b>, and
            <b>testing and debugging skills</b>, which are all essential skills
            for any developer, regardless of the technology or framework they
            are using. I believe that these skills are what set me apart from
            other developers, and i am always looking for ways to improve and
            expand my skill set, so that i can become a better developer and
            deliver better solutions to the end users.
          </p>

        <!-- as backend dev -->
        <div>
          <hr />
          <h2 class="rightSideHeadlines">As a back-end developer</h2>
          <hr />
          <br />
          <p>
            During the academy i studied the basics of backend development and
            learned a second programming language, <b>C#</b>, and i also
            scratched the basics of how to create RESTful APIs, how to use
            databases, and how to handle user authentication and authorization.
            I have also learned how to use various backend technologies, such as
            <b>.NET</b>, <b>Node.js</b> and <b>Express.js</b>, and how to use
            them to create web applications and services. I have also grasped
            the fundamentals and basics of SQL and NoSQL databases, such as
            <b>MySQL</b>, <b>PostgreSQL</b>, <b>MongoDB</b>, and how to use them
            to store and retrieve data.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Proactivity can rarely (in my case never) wait. If i have an idea
            that i know is a killer one, and have some extended free time or i
            see an opportunity to explore it, I want to do it immediately. But
            being a frontend developer, i have come to the realization that i
            need to learn how to manipulate the backend for the applications i
            work on, so that i can explore my ideas and bring them to life.
            Because of that, i started immersing deeper into
            <b>C#</b> and <b>ASP.NET Core</b>, and how to use them to manipulate
            the backend needs of the applications i work on, and how to create
            RESTful APIs that can be used by the frontend applications. I have
            also learned how to use various backend frameworks to bring my ideas
            to life as soon as possible. By having prior basic knowledge, with
            the help of coleagues, AI and online resources, i was able to
            quickly adapt to the backend technologies and frameworks, and i was
            able to create my own methods and logic inside the backend
            applications, opening new endpoints or modifiying the existing ones,
            so that i can create the frontend applications that i envision and
            want to create, thus being able to bring my ideas to life and create
            unique and innovative solutions for the end users.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Later on, by becoming a full-stack developer, i had the opportunity
            and unique insight of both the backend and frontend codebase, which
            is seldom out of sync due to miscomunication between the frontend
            and backend developers, and is a common issue in many projects. By
            having the knowledge of both frontend and backend technologies and
            being the bridge, i was able to refine and align the codebase
            further, clean out unused code on both sides, alligning DTOs and
            create a more cohesive and consistent user experience, also being
            able to identify and fix issues that would otherwise go unnoticed,
            thus improving the overall quality of the applications and codebase
            i work on.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            That same proactivity and eagerness to learn, led me to explore
            <b>DevOps</b> technologies, such as <b>Docker</b>,
            <b>Kubernetes</b>, and <b>CI/CD</b> (Continuous
            Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines, which are essential
            for modern web applications and services. I have learned how to use
            these technologies to automate the deployment and scaling of web
            applications, and how to use them to improve the overall performance
            and reliability of the applications.

            Or what i do in free time, and more about myself as NOT a developer
            :) . First of all, i am a father of 2 children, and a husband to a
            wonderful wife, and i am spending most of my free time with them.
            Other than that i am usually playing the guitar and composing music
            for Ambroz, or taking a walk with my photo camera or editing photos
            that i took of my family, or riding my motorbike to some beatufilul
            scenery to take photos and enjoy sights there, or tending to the
            garden of my weekend house while visiting with the kids, or having a
            beer with my fellow friends. Sometimes i snug some time enjoy
            playing video games, either PC or PS, franchise such as
            S.T.A.L.K.E.R., Fallout, Gran Turismo and Diablo are all time
            favourite, which i can immerse myself into an obscene amount of time
            when one available. My instagram page is
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ivan_jamandilovski/">here</a>,
            and my facebook page is
